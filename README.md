## Build a basic version of PayTM

## we need to make sure only authenticated users can enter dashboard page, 

## probably we need cookies

## and dont show same user name in the users list 

## implement /me endpoint which checks local storage for token, if there, redirect to dashboard, but not there, redirect to signup / sign in 

## redirect all the / (base route requests ) to /me 

## sendMoney should load when request is pending and 
## response should be shown on frontend
